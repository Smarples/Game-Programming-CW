# Game-Programming-CW
Coursework submitted as part of the Game Programming course containing full code for:
1. A Particle Explosion.
2. A Bouncing Ball.
3. Vector Class Listings.

Partial Code for:
A Search Algorithm which would find a path in a 20x20 grid between a user entered start and end point with blockades in random spaces.
-The problem with this project was time but i managed to finish most of the coursework except the algorithm would often get stuck in L shaped blockades that were in the way.

Full game demo using Unity:
Volleybomb - a game where 2 players would control 2 tic-tac shaped people and play volleyball with a bomb which added an extra time limit to the game which intriduced more strategy to the game. This coursework was aimed at teaching the students about the various pitfalls and features of game development.
